# MachineLearningBasics
Here I have put basic Machine Learing tasks implemented from scratch.
This repository contains fundamental implementations of a wide variety of machine learning algorithms and models. Each concept is implemented from scratch or using standard libraries to help solidify understanding through code.


## Contents
The repo conatains the Code folder and the dataset folder for the corresponding datasets used.

## Implementations done 

### Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

### Neural Networks
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**

### Dimensionality Reduction
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

### Representation Learning
- **Autoencoders**
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**
